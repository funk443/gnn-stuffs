This is the repository for my code written for my uni class.  It could potential help you to understand how to use PyTorch Geometric for signal analysis using your own raw signals.

My ways of labeling the signals are quite dumb (hard-coded,) and I'm a little bit lazy to come up with a new one at the moment.

The raw signal I'm using is also provided, which is a TSV file, with each row as a single data point, and the columns as x, y, z axes respectively.
